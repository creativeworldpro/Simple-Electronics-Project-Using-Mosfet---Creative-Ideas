In this project, we are going to show you making a simple electronics project using mosfet and led lights. This project will helps you to decorate your home, office and other places. If you want o buy this type electronics gadgets, then you need to spend a lot amount of money.

But following this method you can easily make this cool electronics project.
 
 
To make this project, you might need some electronics component. These component list have to been given below.

Component List :

1.	Mosfet – IRF z44n *3
2.	Resistor –  1 MΩ *3
3.	Capacitor – 2.2µf/50v *3
4.	LED – 5mm *9
5.	Power Source – DC 12v


Mosfet Pinout – 
IRF z44n is an “N Channel” mosfet. As usual all transistor this transistor also have 3 legs and this 3 legs have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st no “Gate” 2nd no “Drain” and 3rd no “Source”.

Circuit Connection : 

1st we connect all mosfet “Source” leg with a copper wire. Then we connect capacitor with the circuit. Connect Capacitor positive leg with “Gate” leg of mosfet and connect capacitor negative leg with “Source” leg of mosfet. We do the same thing with 3 capacitor and 3 mosfet.

Now We Connect Resistor with the circuit. Connect resistor one terminal  with 1 mosfet “Drain” and other terminal with “Gate” leg of another mosfet. That means we connect resistor with two different mosfet. We do the same process for 3 times.

It is the time to make 12v led light using 5mm leg lights. We connect one led  negative terminal with another led positive terminal. We do this with three leds. After done this process, we connect all led positive terminal. 
N.B. – for better performance we will use 3 colors led light.


Continuously now we connect 3 LED negative terminal with “Drain” leg of three different mosfet. Now we connect power source with the circuit. We connect DC-12v positive cable with LED positive leg and power negative cable with “Source” leg of mosfet.

Finally all circuit connection is complete now. Just Plug-in power and enjoy the music.
